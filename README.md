## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 🏆 certified PSM™ II Scrum Master, 🚀 Founder, and 💻 Full Stack Developer specializing in 🔗 Blockchain and 🌐 Web3 with over 10 years of experience building digital products, scaling platforms, and leading global teams. 🔬 Passionate about technology, innovation, and agile collaboration, I combine business vision with technical expertise to elevate ideas to the next level.

A 🌍 global entrepreneur with 10+ years in the tech industry, specializing in innovation within the developing world's event economy. 🧩 My background blends business administration, agile methodologies (certified Scrum Master PSM™ II), and expertise in emerging technologies like blockchain and Web3. 🤝 I began collaborating with crypto exchanges and P2P platforms, building community through meetups, and contributing thought leadership through specialized writing in print and digital magazines (60,000+ monthly readership). 🚀 This led to managing international health tech projects involving nanotechnology and wearables across Mexico, Panama, and Colombia.

As a 🏅 certified Scrum Master with advanced certifications in 📊 Google Analytics, 📈 Inbound Marketing, and 💡 Entrepreneurship, I've led diverse, geographically dispersed Scrum teams. 🌐 For a global client, I managed four concurrent workstreams (up to 30+ collaborators) across Mexico, Latin America, and Spain, including new feature releases, maintenance, redesign, and operations for web and app platforms. 🛠️ Serving as Scrum Master for multiple operational projects, my responsibilities included resolving QA and security incidents across development, testing, and production environments, maintaining support dashboards, removing impediments, and escalating information.

Most recently, 🏢 I led agile teams on strategic technology projects for the same global entertainment client, impacting users across Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. 🤲 This involved managing distributed teams, demonstrating strong cross-cultural communication skills.

🌟 Recognized as a Global Entrepreneur in 2022 (Global Honor Entrepreneurship Society, welcomed by UNIDO), I'm passionate about leveraging technology for positive social and economic impact. 🚀 My interests encompass Web3, startups, blockchain, analytics, agile methodologies, entrepreneurship, innovation, and business development.

Currently leading international teams from 🇲🇽 on projects for global enterprises, while 🛠️ founding and scaling Web3 products.
